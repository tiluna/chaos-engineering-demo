# Chaos Engineering Demo Application
Welcome to the Chaos Engineering Demo application. This project has been setup to quickly deliver a proof-of-concept for running Chaos Experiments on Azure. It deploys an e-commerce website called _Contoso Traders_ on Azure and includes several chaos experiments that will help validate mitigations against specific failure modes.
